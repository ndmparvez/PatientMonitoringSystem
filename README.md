# PatientMonitoringSystem
In our Patient health monitoring system, we’re going to monitor patient’s health in an automated way. 1) The device will firstly monitor the body health parameters like glucose, temperature, pulse etc. Using different sensors. 2) Then the data collected will be sent to cloud (Thingspeak) using ESP 8266 WiFi module. The Thingspeak IOT platform will store all the parameter data values. 3) These body parameter values will be converted into a data set which we can use in a training algorithm. 4) Using this data set we can train it using ML on Jupyter Notebook, predicting the diseases of the patient. (For example whether he/she has diabetes or not).
